[x] is boiling something nervous  
in a part of their body with no form.   
It moves and they try to speak it,   
They grow wiser when it looms and they're not  

afraid of body, death, someone not   
coming home or speaking quietly.   
An ideology of self, mutable   
only - no not mutable at all, 

only transfigured and sometimes  
in grasp. They are trying  
to speak that feeling right above  
their breasts, which always lands  

somewhere below, a sound  
less visible. They console their  
guilt and all that they have given away  
in the name of growth.

Hexagram Peace (11) > 2,4,6 > The Clinging, Fire (30)  

<br>
**Present**

泰 Peace (11)  
This hexagram denotes a time free of tension. Antagonistic tendencies subside, harmonious relationships exist. But now is the time to be watchful of our inner attitude, to remain conscientious. Times of peace invite us to become overconfident, thus careless of our inner-world responsibilities.

**Changing Lines**

Second Line  
*Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness.*

During times of peace, we are tempted to become hard on others who make mistakes, or to become alienated through having to deal with their troublesome egos. It is in keeping with modesty not to form a mental faction against them but to bear with them.

"Fording the river with resolution." When we are in a peaceful mood and situations arise that require withdrawal and going on our way alone, we should not neglect this duty, or forget our path. This is also to "not neglect what is distant."

"Not regarding one's companions." This means that we do not condition what we do by what others are doing, but keep to our own path.

Especially during peaceful times, we need to prepare for dangers ahead; in this manner we keep our lives in balance and "walk in the middle."

Fourth Line  
*Guileless and sincere.*

In relaxed contacts with people, we should not try to impress them with our abilities, our wit, our charm or our personality. It is best if we do not try to be more than what we are, but associate with people in simplicity.

Sixth Line  
*Use no army now.*

It is time to dismantle our defenses, strategies and efforts to resist Fate, time to disperse effort and striving. We can rely on the higher power to pull us through, because we have this help.

**Future**

離 The Clinging, Fire (30)  
*Care of the cow brings good fortune.*

Attaining and holding onto clarity is the subject of this hexagram. The docility and acceptance of the cow epitomizes the attitude which leads to clarity. Taking care of this docility in ourself is our work. This means that in spite of the difficulty of all challenging forces, we should cling to what is luminous in ourself and others and in life itself, not forsaking our belief in good and its power. When events seem foreboding and people seem evil, we should remember the good that was and is yet to be-the invisible sparks of light that are momentarily eclipsed by people's inferior nature. Holding to this idea is to cling to the power of the light force, thereby enabling the dark force to be overcome.

Clinging to docility helps us keep disconnected from the strength that the inferior power can muster. When others are sharp we can be dull. This clinging enables us to maintain a moderate and just view of our own and other people's mistakes. Such clarity is essential if we are to put life into perspective and have a constructive effect.
