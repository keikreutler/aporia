				How can we use claypots on electric<br>
				stoves when the ruins themselves<br>
				become our only means to utility?<br>
				It's inevitable.<br>
				It's inevitable, someone cries,<br>
				Not knowing where they'll be staying the next<br>
				night or day, a future of protracted infinite<br>
				possibility, assuming this world, or the next<br>
				will definitively end, like a fell wall<br>
				or easily narrated breaking point.
				</p>
				<p>
				We can hardly tie our shoes –<br>
				the longterm thinking can only<br>
				be found on the walls of the fishermen,<br>
				rocks barely holding, sometimes by moss<br>
				and algae, the social security of future<br>
				generations; we can't conceive of collapse<br>
				because it's often so well contained,<br>
				it feels like a hard day, a hard life,<br>
				knitted into one by time.
				</p>
				<p>
				Of course there are days when the pit<br>
				of your stomach feels bottomless and<br>
				deeper than any possible space or distance.<br>
				Where does it go to? Where does it<br>
				heal itself, and eat, again, eventually,<br>
				if lucky? We don't <em>know</em> if the<br>
				fluorescent lights will ever stop,<br>
				but we have a feeling, and we keep<br>
				walking by them.
				</p>
				<p>
				A propositional fallacy: does the error<br>
				lie in our ability to conceive of something<br>
				without taking it fully into ourselves,<br>
				to empathize is not to fall over, bleeding,<br>
				sweaty, too—it's a broken registration form,<br>
				that's the empty way of saying it.<br>
				How can you understand poverty<br>
				without it becoming, without it killing you<br>
				and your body feeling suddenly not yours.
				</p>
				<p>
				This is something<br>
				we must know, this is something that allows us<br>
				to build bridges and write stories only<br>
				about bridges.
