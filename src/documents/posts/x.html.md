[x] is boiling something nervous  
in a part of their body with no form.   
It moves and they try to speak it,   
They grow wiser when it looms and they're not  

afraid of body, death, someone not   
coming home or speaking quietly.   
An ideology of self, mutable   
only - no not mutable at all, 

only transfigured and sometimes  
in grasp. They are trying  
to speak that feeling right above  
their breasts, which always lands  

somewhere below, a sound  
less visible. They console their  
guilt and all that they have given away  
in the name of growth.
