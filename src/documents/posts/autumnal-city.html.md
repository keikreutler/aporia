Amateurs, tell me  
what you loved most before  
before the buildings were  
empty and the sun too hot,  
children unafraid to move  
across the studded sidewalks  
for the blind, in no  
direction but a larger  
hand's. All those bonds are  
disappearing, reconfigured,  
never existent all at once:  
parents, mother, council rep,  
kin, common, brethen,  
ruler, sister, or other  
terms that mayn't help us  
stay alive.
